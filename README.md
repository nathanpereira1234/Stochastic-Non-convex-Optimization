# Stochastic Non-convex Optimization

This is the repository of the Machine learning course project, working with the

The main purpose of this projects was to explore, implement some of the most used optimization algorithms and compare them with Stocastic Cubic Regularization (SCRN) and Stocastic Cubic Regularization with Momentum (SCRN_Momentum) in a non-convex problem.

Optimizer implemented in this repository:

- SGD
- Adam
- Stochastic Cubic Regularization (SCRN)
- Stochastic Cubic Regularization with Momentum (SCRN_Momentum)

Files in this repository:

- `optimizers.py`: contains the optimizers implemented in this repository
- `models.py`: Contain the final model implemented, an enconder with 3 conv net and 3 linear layers.
- `utils.py`
